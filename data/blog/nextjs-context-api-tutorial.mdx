## Next.js Context and React Context

As Next.js is a framework built on top of React, we're able to leverage the latest features released by the team over at Facebook. One of the latest must-use features is the React Context API. In short, Next.js and React Context patterns are the same.

### What is React Context

React Context, introduced in [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html), is a way to share props globally across the React components tree. Some use cases could be managing and passing around user state or a selected theme with the whole of the app without having to manually pass props down to each button through the component tree.

### Why Do We Need React Context

Managing React props across multiple components, determining hierarchy, and forcing a convenient tree structure causes a lot of annoyance and complicated code throughout application development. With the introduction of React Hooks in [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), functional programming through React became more manageable, but still lacked an integrated way to effectively manage state. This led to third-party libraries like Redux being invoked in every project. Though this was a good solution, it wasn't streamlined, led to a lot of context switching, and made it difficult for developers new to React to be able to adopt best practices across a project.

## Creating React Context In a Next.js Application

<Callout

Firstly, invoke a new Next.js app.

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

Create a directory called `lib` in the root of the project and a Context file called `ThemeContext.js`

```jsx
mkdir lib
touch lib/ThemeContext.js
```

Populate the `ThemeContext.js` with the following

```jsx
import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react'

export const themes = {
  light: {
    foreground: '#000000',
    background: '#eeeeee',
  },
  dark: {
    foreground: '#ffffff',
    background: '#222222',
  },
}

export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  theme: undefined,
  setTheme: async (theme) => null,
})

export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext)

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(themes.light)

  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

### Breakdown of React Context File

`import React, { useContext, useState } from "react";` imports the React project and also `useContext` and `userState` modules. Context is just globally set state, so it makes sense that we'll want to invoke it.

`export const themes = {...}` creates some values for us to use based on the theme.

`export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({...})` creates the actual Context along with holding its value. In this case, we're setting the theme's default state to `themes.dark`.

`export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext)` creates a hook to let subscribing components update the theme.

`export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {...}` creates the Provider component that can be subscribed to fetch the theme. This is what exposes our Context to the rest of the project.

`const [theme, setTheme] = useState(themes.light);` set the initial state for us on load of the component itself.

### The Provider Component

The Provider component allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. Each React Context component is shipped with this. Whenever the `value` prop changes, every subscriber to it will be re-rendered.

/>

## Making React Context Available To The Application

Navigate to `pages/_app.js` and surround `Component` with the `ThemeProvider` Context Provider.

```jsx
import '../styles/globals.css'

import { ThemeProvider } from '../lib/ThemeContext'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

This is where the magic of Context is demystified - it's simply another component encapsulating the whole project.

## Consuming Context In A Component

Navigate to`pages/index.js` and import the Context and then destructure the `theme` and `setTheme` state properties.

```jsx
//...
import { useTheme } from '../lib/ThemeContext'

export default function Home() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === themes.dark ? themes.light : themes.dark)
  }

  return (
    //...
    <main className={styles.main}>
      <button
        style={{
          backgroundColor: theme?.background,
          height: 36,
          width: 256,
        }}
        onClick={toggleTheme}
      >
        ThemeContext Toggle
      </button>
      {/*...*/}
    </main>
  )
}https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
```

Run the application.

```jsx
npm run dev
```

The Next.js landing page is updated with a button at the top that will toggle and adopt the theme upon click.
