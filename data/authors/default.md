Shariq is a software architect, media buff, and overall dabbler in all things technology. In his free time, he gives bad
haircuts to his plants - check them out on his [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shariqhiraniphoto). He's a huge fan
of [Plex](https://plex.tv/) and containerizes everything. Take a look at his media
server's [Docker build repo](https://github.com/shariqh/home-server-docker-compose).

Other than a horrible plant trimmer, he is also the host of his own podcast
named [Changelog](https://open.spotify.com/show/29kRN9P3A5dljJmYr3zPsF?si=1bf1d98e982c4dc8),
a [photographer](https://www.shariqhirani.com), and he attempts to write a [blog](/blog).

Full-time he is a cloud-native architect with 11 years of experience in microservice architecture, development, and
CI/CD. He usually builds with Docker on Kubernetes, utilizing GKE and the power of GCP. You could say that this is his
specialty.

Lately, he has been focusing on Next.js and TailwindCSS to create websites. His goal is to always learn something new,
and maybe he can use it to change the world. But as we have seen over these past few years, change does not come so
easily. His other less known goal is to break his addiction to coffee. Seriously, he's dedicating a
[whole webpage](/coffee) to it â˜•.
