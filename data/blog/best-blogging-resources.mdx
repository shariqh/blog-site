If you're trying to start a blog, there's a lot of resources and tools available for free! But with so many out there, it can become confusing as to which ones are right for you and keeping them all centralized.

<Callout text="This post will be a living document and updated as I find more tools" />

Without further ado, here's the list of resources and what they can do for you.

## The Tools

  width={1345}

/>

[Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is great for spell check, grammar, and punctuation on the free account. If you opt for a paid account, you'll get some other goodies. It's like your own marketing department!

[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) helps shrink your .png and .jpg file sizes. I never noticed how slow my images were loading until I saw how fast they could load. 5/7 would recommend.

<Image

  blurDataURL={'/static/images/best-blogging-resources/heroicons.png'}
  alt={'banner'}
  src={'/static/images/best-blogging-resources/heroicons.png'}
  width={1292}
  height={634}
/>

[heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) is brought to us by the developers of TailwindCSS. It's a growing list of SVGs that can be directly added to your HTML.

  alt={'banner'}
  src={'/static/images/best-blogging-resources/iconmonstr.png'}
  width={1246}
  height={621}
/>

[Iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) has a more robust catalog of icons that can be downloaded or embedded as SVGs as well. Between this and heroicons, I have been able to find every icon I needed.

  width={1249}
  height={600}

[Google Ads Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) might be a boon or a bane, I've yet to come to that conclusion. The power of keywords and planning to be ranked on Google search can make your blog, but also make it a chore. I think a few minutes of research per article is fine but focus on creating value in your content more so.

[SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com/) is a premium tool that allows 10 free searches a day and provides _very specific_ insight on what a blog might need to perform well on search engines.

  alt={'banner'}

  height={508}

[Socialsharepreview](https://socialsharepreview.com/) helps ensure that your share previews are correct! Be sure to search your site in their search bar and ensure that all your share images are up to snuff. First impressions hold more value than we may think.

  alt={'banner'}

  width={1247}
  height={480}

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a treasure chest of royalty-free images uploaded by the community. These are great images, but just be sure to crop them to a more manageable size (1200x630) and then throw them into TinyPNG to really save some file space.

<Image
  className="rounded"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={'/static/images/best-blogging-resources/feedhive.png'}
  alt={'banner'}
  src={'/static/images/best-blogging-resources/feedhive.png'}
  width={1248}
  height={564}
/>

[Feedhive](http://feedhive.io) is a new player in the field but makes cross-posting between social media platforms much less painful. As of now, they support LinkedIn and Twitter with Facebook and Instagram on the horizon. The free tier is pretty generous, especially if you don't plan too far ahead of time.

  width={846}
  height={261}
/>

[Favicon-generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) is great for getting all those pesky little icons created for all the potential platforms. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Android all have different specifications. Do yourself a favor and let this site figure it out for you.

  width={1127}
  height={459}

[Fiverr](https://fiverr.com/) is great for getting some professional resources created. We're talking logos, favicons, business cards, and whatever else you may think of.

<Callout text="Use the social icons in the footer if there's a tool you believe should be added to the list!" />
