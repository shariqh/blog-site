Other than a horrible plant trimmer, I am also the host of a podcast called [Changelog](https://open.spotify.com/show/29kRN9P3A5dljJmYr3zPsF?si=1bf1d98e982c4dc8), a [photographer](https://www.shariqhirani.com), and I attempt to write a [blog](/blog).

Full time, I am cloud native architect with eleven years of experience in microservice architecture, development, and CI/CD. I usually build on Kubernetes, utilizing GKE and the power of GCP. I guess you could say that this is my specialty.

Lately I have been focusing on Next.js and TailwindCSS to create websites. The goal is to always learn something new, and maybe I can use it to change the world. But as we have seen over these past few year, change does not come so easily. My other, less known goal, is to break my addiction to coffee. Seriously, I dedicated a [whole webpage](/coffee) to it â˜•.
